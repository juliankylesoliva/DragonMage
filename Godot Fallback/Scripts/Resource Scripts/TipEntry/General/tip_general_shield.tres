tip_description = Array[String](["Starting from Chapter 1-1, you can press and hold [Fairy Ability] to have Knigel protect you with a magic shield.

This spell initially costs 5% of Knigel's magic meter and drains 12% magic per second while active. Knigel loses 10% magic when blocking damage.

You cannot move nor attack while the shield is active, but pressing [Move Left] or [Move Right] will change the direction the shield is facing, and jumping instantly cancels the shield.

Beware that damage from stage hazards (i.e. spikes) cannot be blocked by the shield.", "If your temper meter ever goes critical, holding the shield up will triple your temper meter's recovery rate. Use this if you got magic to spare and there are no nearby temper dragonfruits.", "If you let go of [Fairy Ability] while the shield is up, there is a 0.1 second (6 frame) window where you can get hit to parry and nullify damage. This can instantly defeat common enemies, reflect enemy projectiles, and temporarily disable certain stage hazards on top of restoring 30% of Knigel's magic meter.", "Press [Fairy Ability] when Knigel's magic meter is at 100% to have him envelop you in a stronger, more mobile shield that makes you invincible, defeats enemies on contact, and reflects enemy projectiles for a few seconds*. Your temper meter also gets balanced when this shield is activated.

*The duration can be slightly extended by collecting fragments and hitting enemies or blocks with your attacks."])
