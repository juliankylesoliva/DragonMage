These small, ashy fragments can be found scattered all across the land. They are said to have belonged to the scales of an ancient dragon who lived about a thousand years ago...

These fragments react and change color when they are collected by a mage or a dragon; it might help to keep the amount of each color as equal as possible.

If you ever take damage, you will lose up to ten fragments, and cannot recover them. The color you have the most of will usually be the first ones to go.

Collect enough fragments in a level to receive a collection rating!", "Ancient Scales

You can visually sense the presence of these scales, but they will not be tangible unless you first collect the required amount of fragments to reform them.

There are three types of scales to be found in each level: Magical, Draconic, and Balanced. Magical Scales require blue mage fragments, Draconic Scales require orange dragon fragments, and Balanced Scales require both fragment colors.

Unlike fragments, you cannot drop collected scales no matter how much damage you take.", "Time Medallion

If you manage to clear a stage from start to finish before the target time, you will earn a Time Medallion.

While it is possible to earn every Time Medallion through pure speed alone, collecting fragments and scales may make things a lot easier.", "Time Reduction Bonus - I

When you finish a level with enough fragments collected, you can reduce your clear time by up to 35% or more depending on certain factors.

At least 15% for collecting the minimum amount of fragments--higher if more fragments were collected, but you dont need to collect ALL of them.

Up to 10% for keeping the number of blue and orange fragments equal on top of collecting the minimum amount.", "Time Reduction Bonus - II

Up to 10% for five possible collection ratings:

- Not enough... (0%):
	Less than the minimum fragments collected.

- MAGE MAJORITY! (1%):
	All or more than 2/3 of your fragments are blue.

- DRAGON DOMINANT! (3%):
	All or more than 2/3 of your fragments are orange.

- KINDA BALANCED! (5%):
	Less than 2/3 majority of each color fragment.

- HALF N' HALF! (10%):
	Amount of blue and orange fragments are equal.", "Time Reduction Bonus - III

The other 15% of the clear time reduction comes from collecting the Magical, Draconic, and Balanced scales:

- First scale you collect is worth 2%.

- Second scale you collect is worth 5% (7% total).

- Third scale you collect is worth 8% (15% total).

Unlike the previous bonuses, you do not need to collect the minimum amount of fragments for the whole level to earn these bonuses.", "An Optional Level Mastery Challenge

See if you can earn a HALF N' HALF! fragment collection rating and get all three scales while still being fast enough to reduce your time for a Time Medallion!"])
