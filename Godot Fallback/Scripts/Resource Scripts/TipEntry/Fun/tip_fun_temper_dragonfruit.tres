tip_description = Array[String](["A magically-cultivated species of dragonfruit that quickly shifts between three distinct colors and flavors as it ripens. Once fully ripened, the dragonfruit settles on one of three possible color-flavor pairings.

The fruit also seem to have an impact on one's mood--or temper, hence the name--when eaten which can vary depending on the color as well as the consumer.

The blue color is sweet and mellowing, orange is sour and enraging, and green has a satisfying combination of the two flavors while balancing out one's mood."])
