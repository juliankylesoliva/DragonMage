Normally, you need to be at least one tile off the ground in order to start wall climbing, but a rising Fire Tackle ([Move Up]+[Attack]) simply checks if you are off the ground regardless of distance.", "You can also transfer the upward momentum of your wall climb into your Fire Tackle by pressing [Attack] while wall climbing. Just be sure to pivot the Fire Tackle before releasing [Attack]."])
