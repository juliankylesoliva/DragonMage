	WOW, I didn't think we'd be this high up on the rooftop of a parking garage... Knigel said that we can't risk getting captured on the city streets, so we have to stay on the rooftops. I hate to admit it, and this may seem ironic, but I'm actually afraid of heights. Although... they don't seem all that scary with Knigel by my side. I must be just as brave as him for his sake!

	Oh dear... looks like there are more Dragoons here, too, and with fully functioning wings at that. Also, some of the walls here look too slippery for me to hold on to!
