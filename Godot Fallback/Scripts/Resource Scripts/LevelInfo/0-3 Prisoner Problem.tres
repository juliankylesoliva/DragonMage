	How did we get so careless!? Knigel and I strayed too far from our usual training route, and we ended up getting ambushed by some Dragoons from the Dragon Syndicate! They were after my magic powers, but Knigel managed to hold them back long enough for me to run away and hide. As I was watching him fight, I saw one of the Dragoons zapping Knigel with a strange device, which left behind nothing but his clothes! Without thinking, I ran back to those Dragoons and knocked them all away with my Magic Blast!", "May 6, 202X - Evening (2/3)

	When I knelt beside where Knigel stood, I was shocked to see that Knigel was alive, but as a tiny fairy! With no time to explain, we tried to leave the mountains as quickly as possible to get help, but the Dragoons caught up to us again and captured us! I would've fought back, but they were easily holding Knigel hostage due to his now smaller size... Just as they were about to siphon my magic as well, my hat fell off as I was struggling to break free from their grasp, and they saw that I was a dragon because of my horns!", "May 6, 202X - Evening (3/3)

	Unsure of what to do with me due to having magic powers as a dragon, the Dragoons decided to lock us up in the Dragon Syndicate's prison on the outskirts of Drakageau for now as they will leave that decision up to their boss tomorrow morning...
