	I CAN'T BELIEVE MY STAR MODEL EXPLODED DURING THE PRESENTATION! The spell was just fine once I arrived at work, but my boss rushed me into the meeting with NO TIME TO PREPARE! I got so nervous and stressed from all those people watching me fumble throughout my presentation that my hands started shaking and I DROPPED THE STAR I WAS HOLDING AND GOT LAUNCHED THROUGH THE CEILING TRYING TO COVER UP THE IMMINENT BLAST!!!!!", "May 6, 2024 - Afternoon (2/2)

	Luckily, nobody else got hurt, but the boss relentlessly yelled at me in his office after that blunder, and I got too scared to explain myself... At least until Knigel--my boyfriend / childhood friend / the security knight at Magi Co.--managed to calm both of us down and helped me explain what happened this morning, and I was simply sent home for the day while the boss decides the fate of my employment by tommorow. For now, I really owe Knigel for having my back there and for supporting me over the past 17 years. Before I went back home, Knigel reminded me about our nightly training at the mountains later, and I can't wait to show him how much I've improved at wielding my dragon powers!
