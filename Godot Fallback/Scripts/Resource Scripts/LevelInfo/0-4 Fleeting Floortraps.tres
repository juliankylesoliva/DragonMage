	After experimenting with my mage and dragon powers to escape our prison, Faeson--I mean--Knigel and I managed to find what looked like some sort of exit tunnel. We walked through hoping it would be a simple tunnel to the outside, but we were quickly proven wrong when we noticed that the floors ahead of us were starting to protrude spikes! I don't know who runs this place, but it seems like they've caught wind of our whereabouts and are now trying to make our escape as difficult as possible!
