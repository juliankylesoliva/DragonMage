	After experimenting with the many different ways to combine my mage and dragon powers to escape from our prison cell, Knigel and I managed to find what looked like some sort of exit tunnel. We walked through hoping it would be as simple as walking right on through to the outside, but we were quickly proven wrong when we noticed that the floor started to protrude spikes as I took each step! I was so frightened that I think my dragon powers stopped working for a minute there... I don't know who runs this prison, but it seems like they've caught wind of our whereabouts and are now trying to make our escape as difficult as possible!
