	Oh, just my luck... The trains are delayed due to the Dragon Syndicate's latest shenanigans and I'm going to be late for work at this rate! Of all days it had to be the day I have to present my work to Magi Co's CEO who just so happens to also be my boss... The board is going to be there judging me, too... Luckily, there's a forest I can take a shortcut through, which is the perfect spot to test out the spell I'm presenting, the Magic Blast! It's still just a prototype, so I hope it doesn't get worn out too much by the time the meeting starts...
