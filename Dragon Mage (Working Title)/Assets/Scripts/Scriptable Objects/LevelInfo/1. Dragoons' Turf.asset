  _storyDescription: Having escaped the Dragon Syndicate's prison, Magli finds herself
    at the outskirts of Drakageau, and her only chance of not getting caught again
    is to reach the city; however, several members of the Dragon Syndicate, called
    Dragoons, patrol the area and block her way! Fortunately, they all happen to
    be low-ranking members, but they each have different behaviors depending on the
    color of their suit!
