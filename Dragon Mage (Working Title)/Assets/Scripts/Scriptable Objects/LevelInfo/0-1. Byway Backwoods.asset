  _storyDescription: 'Magli is a timid mage who is running late for her first day
    of work as a spell developer. The trains have been delayed due to the tracks
    being damaged, and Magli must make a beeline through the forest to get to her
    workplace. On the bright side, she sees that this is a great time to test out
    her latest spell: the Magic Blast! It''s only a prototype, but hopefully the
    spell won''t malfunction by the time Magli presents it to her boss and coworkers...'
