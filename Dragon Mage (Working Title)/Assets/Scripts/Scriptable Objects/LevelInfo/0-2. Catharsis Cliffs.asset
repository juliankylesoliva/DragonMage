  _storyDescription: After a disasterous first day at work, Magli returns to her
    apartment and goes straight to bed hoping to forget the day's events. In the
    middle of the night, however, Magli lies awake feeling restless--a feeling she
    is all too familiar with following incidents like this... The mage quickly makes
    her way to the nearby mountains outside of town, and after ensuring that nobody's
    looking, she unleashes her confident dragon self, Draelyn! The dragon makes her
    way to a place where she can practice using her dragon powers in solitude...
